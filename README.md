# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project examining passenger survival patterns from the 1912 Titanic disaster using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis explores what factors influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster, with a focus on:
- Gender and survival
- Socioeconomic class (passenger class)
- Age distribution
- Combined effects of multiple factors

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Gender was the strongest predictor of survival**
   - Women: 74.2% survival rate
   - Men: 18.9% survival rate

2. **Class inequality was significant**
   - 1st Class: 63% survived
   - 2nd Class: 47% survived
   - 3rd Class: 24% survived

3. **Shocking insight: Gender mattered more than wealth**
   - 3rd class women (50%) survived better than 1st class men (37%)
   - "Women and children first" protocol was strictly enforced

4. **Age played a moderate role**
   - Children had relatively better survival rates
   - Young adult men (20-40) faced the highest mortality

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

### Visualizations Created:
- Age distribution histogram
- Survival comparison by age (overlapping histograms)
- Multi-factor analysis: Class + Gender combined

### Statistical Analysis:
- Survival rates by demographic groups
- Missing data assessment
- Cross-tabulation analysis

## 💡 Insights & Conclusions

The analysis reveals that survival on the Titanic was heavily influenced by gender and socioeconomic status. The "women and children first" evacuation protocol created a stark gender disparity in survival rates that even superseded class advantages - poor women had better survival odds than wealthy men.

This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insight generation from historical data.

## 🎓 About

This project was created as part of my journey into data analytics, focusing on:
- Building data analysis skills from scratch
- Learning by doing rather than just watching tutorials
- Creating portfolio-worthy projects with real insights
